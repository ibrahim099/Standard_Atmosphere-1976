The 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere is a model established in the United States to standardize the physical properties of the atmosphere at various altitudes. This model is used for aircraft and spacecraft engineering, meteorology, atmospheric science, and various aerodynamic calculations.
Key Features of the Model

    Geopotential Height (H):
        Instead of using the actual height measured from the Earth's surface, the "geopotential height," which accounts for the variation in Earth's gravitational force, is used. This allows for more accurate calculations.

    Temperature (T):
        The standard temperature at sea level is considered to be 288.15 Kelvin (15°C).
        In the troposphere (0-11 km), temperature decreases linearly with height. The rate of decrease (a) is -0.0065 K/m.
        In the stratosphere (11-20 km), the temperature is constant at 216.65 Kelvin.

    Pressure (P):
        The standard pressure at sea level is considered to be 101325 Pascals (Pa).
        Pressure decreases exponentially with height, and this decrease is calculated based on the relationship between temperature and height.

    Density (ρ):
        The density of air is determined based on pressure and temperature values, decreasing with increasing altitude.

    Speed of Sound (a):
        The speed of sound is proportional to the square root of temperature and therefore changes with height.

    Dynamic Viscosity (μ):
        The viscosity of air changes with temperature and is calculated using the Sutherland equation.

Applications

    Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering:
        Used in the design and performance analysis of aircraft and rockets.
        Provides standard atmospheric conditions for flight simulations.

    Meteorology:
        Used for the calibration of weather forecasting models.
        Serves as a reference in climate change research.

    Atmospheric Science:
        Used as a reference model in atmospheric research and experiments.

    Hydrostatic and Aerodynamic Calculations:
        Used in ballistic engineering and various engineering applications to simulate atmospheric conditions.

While the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere model does not perfectly reflect real atmospheric conditions, it provides a reliable and widely accepted reference for engineering and scientific calculations. This model is a fundamental tool used in a wide range of applications, from the design of air vehicles to climate research.
